THE SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE IS CONTROLLED BASED ON THE DISCHARGE AIR DUCT TEMPERATURE SENSOR SET AT 55°F. (ADJ)THE PRE-HEAT, AND COOLING COIL SHALL MODULATE WITHOUT OVERLAP TO MAINTAIN SETPOINT TEMPERATURE.2.WHEN THE OUTSIDE ENTHALPY IS BELOW THE RETURN AIR ENTHALPY, MIXED AIR ECONOMIZER DAMPERS MODULATE IN SEQUENCE WITHOUT OVERLAP TO MAINTAIN THE SUPPLY TEMPERATURE SET POINT (ADJ).
