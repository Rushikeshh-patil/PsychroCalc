 

4.SUPPLY DUCT PRESSURIZATION CONTROL:
4.1.THE SUPPLY FAN VFD WILL MODULATE AS NECESSARY TO MAINTIN THE SUPPLY AIR STATIC PRESSURE AT THE STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT. THE STATIC PRESSURE SET POINT SHALL BE RESET BETWEEN 0.75 IN WC AND 1 IN WC (ADJUSTABLE)TO MAINTAIN THE MAXIMUM ZONE DAMPER POSITION BETWEEN 80% AND 99% OPEN. EACH ZONE SERVED BY THE AIR HANDLER SHALL BE EVALUATED TO FIND THE MAXIMUM DAMPER POSITION. 
4.2.UPON INITIAL STARTUP OF THE AIR HANDLING SYSTEM THE SUPPLY FAN SPEED SHALL SLOWLY RAMP UP TO MAINTAIN THE STATIC PRESSURE SET POINT. UPON SHUTDOWN OF THE AIR HANDLING SYSTEM THE SUPPLY FAN VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVES ARE STOPPED AND THE SPEED CONTROL SIGNAL SHALL MODULATE TO ZERO SPEED.


6.THE SYSTEM SHALL OPERATE DURING UNOCCUPIED  MODE  AS FOLLOWS:
6.1.UNIT SHALL DE-ENERGIZE  AND ALL DAMPERS SHALL BE POSITIONED TO THE NORMAL POSITION. 
6.2.UNIT SHALL RESTART AND OPERATE IN THE NIGHT SETBACK MODE WHEN THE SPACE TEMPERATURE RISES/FALLS ABOVE THE NIGHT SETBACK SET POINTS. REFER TO NIGHT SETBACK MODE FOR SEQUENCE. 

6.3.DURING UNOCCUPIED MODE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL BE CLOSED.

7.OPTIMUM START: THE DDC SYSTEM SHALL MONITOR AND TRACK TEMPERATURES AND START UP TIME TO PROVIDE A OPTIMUM START SEQUENCE TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT AT STARTUP.

8.MORNING WARMUP: THE OUTSIDE AIR AND RELIEF AIR DAMPERS SHALL CLOSE. THE VAVS SHALL GO TO HEATING CFM. THE PREHEAT COIL SHALL OPERATE AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE PREHEAT LEAVING COIL TEMPERATURE.  THE  VAV REHEAT COILS  SHALL MODULATE TO OBTAIN THE SPACE SETPOINT TEMPERATURE. THE UNIT SHALL RETURN TO OCCUPIED MODE UPON SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT BEING ACHIEVED.  INDIVIDUAL ZONES REHEAT COILS SHALL CLOSE TO PREVENT OVERHEATING

9.MORNING COOL DOWN: THE OUTSIDE AIR AND RELIEF AIR DAMPERS SHALL CLOSE. THE VAVS SHALL GO TO FULL COOLING CFM. THE COOLING COIL SHALL MODULATE TO OBTAIN THE SPACE SETPOINT TEMPERATURE. THE UNIT SHALL RETURN TO OCCUPIED MODE UPON THE SPACE SET POINT BEING ACHIEVED.  INDIVIDUAL ZONE REHEAT COILS SHALL MODULATE OPEN TO PREVENT OVERCOOLING

10.BUILDING PRESSURIZATION AND FAN TRACKING: THE AIR FLOW OF THE SUPPLY AND RETURN AIR FANS SHALL BE MONITORED BY THE DDC SYSTEM. THE RETURN AIR FAN VFD SHALL BE CONTROLLED BY THE DDC SYSTEM TO TRACK THE SUPPLY AIR AND RETURN AIR QUANTITIES. THE RETURN FAN VFD SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED RETURN AIRFLOW AT THE RETURN AIRFLOW SETPOINT, CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SUPPLY AIRFLOW, EXHAUST AIRFLOW AND THE CFM DIFFERENTIAL REQUIRED. FINAL OFFSET VALUES SHALL BE BASED ON FINAL TAB AIRFLOW VALUES.  

11.MIXED AIR PLENUM PRESSURE OVERRIDE: THE MIXED AIR NEGATIVE PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL BE DETERMINED AT FINAL TAB WHEN SUPPLY FAN AT MINIMUM CFM, OUTSIDE AIR IS AT MINIMUM CFM AND RETURN FAN SET TO MAINTAIN POSITIVE BUILDING PRESSURE.  IF THE MIXED AIR PRESSURE INCREASES FROM THE NEGATIVE SETPOINT THE RETURN FAN CONTROL SHALL OVERRIDE AND  RETURN FAN SHALL SLOW AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE NEGATIVE PRESSURE SET POINT.  FAN SPEED SHALL ADJUST AS REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR EXHAUST FAN CFM QUANITY ASSOCIATED WITH AIR HANDLER. REFER TO EXHAUST FAN AHU/EF MATRIX.

12.DEMAND CONTROL VENTILATION (AH-1,8&9 ONLY): IF THE CRITICAL ZONE RISES ABOVE 700 PPM THE MINIMUM OUTSIDE AIR CFM SETPOINT WILL BE RESET BASED ON THE WORST CASE ZONE CO2 LEVEL. A PID LOOP WILL MAINTAIN THE CO2 LEVEL AT BELOW 700 PPM (ADJ) SETPOINT BY RESETTING THE OUTSIDE AIR MINIMUM CFM SETPOINT BETWEEN THE "UPPER" MINIMUM  INDICATED ON THE SCHEDULES AND "LOWER" MINIMUM CFM SETPOINTS. THE "LOWER" CFM MINIMUM CFM SETOINT WILL BE EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF THE FOLLOWING VALUES:

	     1. THE BUILDING COMPONENT OUTDOOR AIRFLOW 		         RATE OF 2,200 CFM (AH-1), 1,360 CFM (AH-8), AND
	         2,350 CFM (AH-9).

	     2. THE EXHAUST FAN MAKEUP CFM PLUS THE CFM 		         DIFFERENTIAL AS DETERMINED DURING TEST AND 		         BALANCE		
	    



13.FREEZE PROTECTION: 
13.1.UNIT ON: IF THE FREEZE THERMOSTAT INDICATES A LOW LIMIT CONDITION (36F) THE PREHEAT COIL SHALL MODULATE OPEN UNTIL TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE LOW LIMIT CONDITION. IF TEMPERATURE CONTINUES TO DROP BELOW THE  LOW LIMIT CONDITION THE OUTSIDE AIR AND RELIEF AIR DAMPERS SHALL CLOSE AND MIXED AIR DAMPER SHALL OPEN TO 100% FOR FREEZE PROTECTION.
13.2.UNIT OFF: IF THE FREEZE THERMOSTAT INDICATES A LOW LIMIT CONDITION (36F) . THE OUTSIDE AIR AND RELIEF AIR DAMPERS SHALL REMAIN CLOSED. THE PREHEAT COIL SHALL MODULATE OPEN UNTIL TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE LOW LIMIT CONDITION.  

14.SYSTEM SAFETY: ANY OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS SHALL RESULT IN DEACTIVATION OF THE AIR HANDLING UNITS; DISCHARGE AIR HIGH STATIC CUTOUT, LOW LIMIT STATIC PRESSURE CUTOUT, LOW LIMIT TEMPERATURE READING,  SMOKE DETECTOR IN THE SUPPLY AIR STREAM, SMOKE DAMPER SHUT, SUPPLY/RETURN FAN VFD FAULT ALARM, AND ATFP ALARM SIGNAL. THE DDC SYSTEM SHALL USE THE VFD CURRENT SENSOR TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE SUPPLY AND RETURN AIR FAN AND GENERATE ALARM CONDITION WHEN EITHER OF THE SENSORS INDICATE A FAN FAILURE WHILE THE UNITS ARE COMMANDED ON.  THE ALARM CONDITION SHALL BE INDICATED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FAN MOTOR HAS FAILED OR NOT. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOTIFY THE OPERATOR AUTOMATICALLY.

15.FILTERS: THE PRESSURE LOSS THROUGH THE FILTERS SHALL BE MONITORED AT THE DDC SYSTEM AND AN ALARM SHALL BE GENERATED WHEN THE PRESSURE LOSS EXCEEDS THE ALLOWABLE FILTER PRESSURE LOSS.
